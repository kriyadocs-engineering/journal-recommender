As a rule, the complex nature of a phenomenon is manifested in the underlying intricate geometry which in most of the cases can be described in terms of objects with non-integer (fractal) dimension. In other cases, the distribution of events in time or various other quantities show specific scaling behavior, thus providing a better understanding of the relevant factors determining the given processes. Using fractal geometry and scaling as a language in the related theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations, it has been possible to get a deeper insight into previously intractable problems.

Economic considerations, including efficiency, equity, production, allocation, and pollution, have expanded as water resources have become scarcer both in terms of quantity and quality. While economic analyses applied to the water sector are useful and educational, their policy implications are less obvious for guiding policymakers. Water Economics and Policy (WEP) will address the economic-policy interaction by publishing highly technical water economics research with clear relevance for policy. WEP will aim to target a wide range of economic questions at local, regional, national and international levels. It will accommodate work that is focused on specific sectors (such as urban, hydropower, irrigation, and environment) as well as work that is inter-sectoral in nature. Theoretical and empirical papers are sought as well as those that demonstrate the integration of economics with scientific perspectives to support policy analysis. WEP will also publish book reviews and selected featured policy articles by policymakers in the field of water.",0.3550,Q3,17,34,91,1.3200,100,2382624X; 23826258,"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Environmental Science; Business, Management and Accounting","Business and International Management (Q3); Economics and Econometrics (Q3); Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law (Q3); Water Science and Technology (Q3)"
