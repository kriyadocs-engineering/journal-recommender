      "scope": "The purpose of this journal is to provide a medium of exchange for scientists engaged in applied sciences (physics, mathematical physics, natural, and technological sciences) where there exists a non-trivial interplay between mathematics, mathematical modelling of real systems and mathematical and computer methods oriented towards the qualitative and quantitative analysis of real physical systems. The principal areas of interest of this journal are the following: 1.Mathematical modelling of systems in applied sciences; 2.Mathematical methods for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of models of mathematical physics and technological sciences; 3.Numerical and computer treatment of mathematical models or real systems. Special attention will be paid to the analysis of nonlinearities and stochastic aspects. Within the above limitation, scientists in all fields which employ mathematics are encouraged to submit research and review papers to the journal. Both theoretical and applied papers will be considered for publication. High quality, novelty of the content and potential for the applications to modern problems in applied sciences and technology will be the guidelines for the selection of papers to be published in the journal. This journal publishes only articles with original and innovative contents. Book reviews, announcements and tutorial articles will be featured occasionally.",

The important subjects of structural stability and structural dynamics are placed together in this journal because they share somewhat fundamental elements. In recognition of the considerable research interests and recent proliferation of papers in these subjects, it is hoped that the journal may help bring together papers focused on related subjects, including the state-of-the-art surveys, so as to provide a more effective medium for disseminating the latest developments to researchers and engineers. This journal features a section for technical notes that allows researchers to publish their initial findings or new ideas more speedily. Discussions of papers and concepts will also be published so that researchers can have a vibrant and timely communication with others.",

      "scope": "The investigation of phenomena involving complex geometry, patterns and scaling has gone through a spectacular development and applications in the past decades. For this relatively short time, geometrical and/or temporal scaling have been shown to represent the common aspects of many processes occurring in an unusually diverse range of fields including physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, economics, engineering and technology, and human behavior. As a rule, the complex nature of a phenomenon is manifested in the underlying intricate geometry which in most of the cases can be described in terms of objects with non-integer (fractal) dimension. In other cases, the distribution of events in time or various other quantities show specific scaling behavior, thus providing a better understanding of the relevant factors determining the given processes. Using fractal geometry and scaling as a language in the related theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations, it has been possible to get a deeper insight into previously intractable problems. Among many others, a better understanding of growth phenomena, turbulence, iterative functions, colloidal aggregation, biological pattern formation, stock markets and inhomogeneous materials has emerged through the application of such concepts as scale invariance, self-affinity and multifractality. The main challenge of the journal devoted exclusively to the above kinds of phenomena lies in its interdisciplinary nature; it is our commitment to bring together the most recent developments in these fields so that a fruitful interaction of various approaches and scientific views on complex spatial and temporal behaviors in both nature and society could take place.",

The Journal editorial recognizes that international accounting is influenced by a variety of forces, e.g., governmental, political and economic. Thus, the primary criterion for manuscript evaluation is the incremental contribution to international accounting literature and the forces that impact the field. The Journal aims at understanding the present and potential ability of accounting to aid in analyzing and interpreting international economic transactions and the economic consequences of such reporting. These transactions may be within a profit or non-profit environment. The Journal encourages a broad view of the origins and development of accounting with an emphasis on its functions in an increasingly interdependent global economy. The Journal also welcomes manuscripts that help explain current international accounting practices, with related theoretical justifications, and identify criticisms of current policies and practice. Other than occasional commissioned papers or special issues, all the manuscripts published in the Journal are selected by the editors after the normal double-blind refereeing process.",

It constitutes an essential and central point of reference for the large number of mathematicians, mathematical physicists and other scientists who have been drawn into these areas. Both fields have strong interdisciplinary nature, with deep connection to, for example, classical probability, stochastic analysis, mathematical physics, operator algebras, irreversibility, ergodic theory and dynamical systems, quantum groups, classical and quantum stochastic geometry, quantum chaos, Dirichlet forms, harmonic analysis, quantum measurement, quantum computer, etc. The journal reflects this interdisciplinarity and welcomes high quality papers in all such related fields, particularly those which reveal connections with the main fields of this journal.",

Knot theory as a core mathematical discipline is subject to many forms of generalization (virtual knots and links, higher-dimensional knots, knots and links in other manifolds, non-spherical knots, recursive systems analogous to knotting). Knots live in a wider mathematical framework (classification of three and higher dimensional manifolds, statistical mechanics and quantum theory, quantum groups, combinatorics of Gauss codes, combinatorics, algorithms and computational complexity, category theory and categorification of topological and algebraic structures, algebraic topology, topological quantum field theories). Papers that will be published include: -new research in the theory of knots and links, and their applications; -new research in related fields; -tutorial and review papers. With this Journal, we hope to serve well researchers in knot theory and related areas of topology, researchers using knot theory in their work, and scientists interested in becoming informed about current work in the theory of knots and its ramifications.",

WEP will aim to target a wide range of economic questions at local, regional, national and international levels. It will accommodate work that is focused on specific sectors (such as urban, hydropower, irrigation, and environment) as well as work that is inter-sectoral in nature. Theoretical and empirical papers are sought as well as those that demonstrate the integration of economics with scientific perspectives to support policy analysis.

Such papers need not necessarily demonstrate, in the early stages of research and development, the full potential of new findings on a physical or virtual robot. IJHR welcomes original papers in the following categories: Research papers, which disseminate scientific findings contributing to solving technical issues underlying the development of humanoid robots, or biologically-inspired robots, having multiple functionality related to either physical capabilities (i.e. motion) or mental capabilities (i.e. intelligence) Review articles, which describe, in non-technical terms, the latest in basic theories, principles, and algorithmic solutions Short articles (e.g. feature articles and dialogues), which discuss the latest significant achievements and the future trends in robotics R&D Papers on curriculum development in humanoid robot education Book reviews.",

Financial instruments that have been designed to serve the needs of mature capital markets and established trading forums need to be adapted for application in emerging markets and evolving trading venues. The development of new financial products and trading methodologies has also led to new challenges for regulatory bodies. Issues addressed in IJTAF include: (a) development of sophisticated mathematical models based on the principles of modern finance theory, (b) calibration of these models to market data, (c) simulation of such models using efficient computational algorithms, (d) updating of these models in line with evolving market developments, and (e) adaptation of these models by the practitioners in the industry; emphasis will also be placed on (f) development and application of modern stochastic methods in finance. State-of-the-art financial modelling draws upon expertise from various disciplines besides finance; in particular, experts from mathematics, statistics, economics, and computer science have made significant contributions to this field. IJTAF brings together experts from these multi-disciplines and provides a platform for the synthesis of the various specializations that are actively involved in financial modelling. The disciplines covered by IJTAF include: mathematical finance; financial engineering; applications of modern probability theory and stochastic analysis in finance; models for interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, commodity, credit and inflation-linked products; portfolio theory and long-term investment; quantification of risk; ...",

International Journal of Semantic Computing (IJSC) addresses the computing technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, natural language, software engineering, data and knowledge engineering, computer systems, signal processing, etc.), and their interactions, that may be used to extract or process computational content and descriptions. While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as isolated pieces in journals dedicated to individual disciplines, IJSC is a journal that glues these pieces together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g., pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can be synthesized and accessed. IJSC publishes regular papers, review papers, case studies, tutorials, communications, book reviews, conference reports, industry trends, and product reviews.",

The research studies employ creativity, discovery, rationale design and improvement of the physical and chemical properties of materials leading to new paradigms for competitive energy-production. The challenge tests both our fundamental understanding of material and our ability to manipulate and reconfigure materials into practical and useful configurations. Invariably these materials issues arise at the nano-scale! For electricity generation, dramatic breakthroughs are taking place in the fields of solar cells and fuel cells, the former giving rise to entirely new classes of semiconductors; the latter testing our knowledge of the behavior of ionic transport through a solid medium. Inenergy-storage exciting developments are emerging from the fields of rechargeable batteries and hydrogen storage. On the horizon are breakthroughs in thermoelectrics, high temperature superconductivity, and power generation. Still to emerge are the harnessing of systems that mimic nature, ranging from fusion, as in the sun, to photosynthesis, nature's photovoltaic. All of these approaches represent a body of materials–based research employing the most sophisticated experimental and theoretical techniques dedicated to a commongoal. The aim of this series is to capture these advances, through a collection of volumes authored by leading physicists, chemists, biologists and engineers that represent the forefront of energy-related materials research.",
