The articles should present comprehensive, critical summaries of current knowledge in the field, in other words, authoritative narrative review articles. The content of the article should not be limited to a discussion of the author's work. Sufficient historical or other background material may be included for those readers who are not current with the latest advances in the particular field. If the material covered is controversial, the author should attempt to provide balanced coverage. Appropriate reviews would include those addressing pathogenic mechanisms, specific or groups of microbial pathogens, clinical and laboratory aspects of newly recognized or reemerging infectious diseases, recently developed antimicrobial agents and their application, and new diagnostic laboratory technology."
