For this relatively short time, geometrical and/or temporal scaling have been shown to represent the common aspects of many processes occurring in an unusually diverse range of fields including physics, mathematics, biology, chemistry, economics, engineering and technology, and human behavior. As a rule, the complex nature of a phenomenon is manifested in the underlying intricate geometry which in most of the cases can be described in terms of objects with non-integer (fractal) dimension. In other cases, the distribution of events in time or various other quantities show specific scaling behavior, thus providing a better understanding of the relevant factors determining the given processes.\r\nUsing fractal geometry and scaling as a language in the related theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations, it has been possible to get a deeper insight into previously intractable problems. Among many others, a better understanding of growth phenomena, turbulence, iterative functions, colloidal aggregation, biological pattern formation, stock markets and inhomogeneous materials has emerged through the application of such concepts as scale invariance, self-affinity and multifractality.\r\n\r\nThe main challenge of the journal devoted exclusively to the above kinds of phenomena lies in its interdisciplinary nature; it is our commitment to bring together the most recent developments in these fields so that a fruitful interaction of various approaches and scientific views on complex spatial and temporal behaviors in both nature and society could take place."

The Journal editorial recognizes that international accounting is influenced by a variety of forces, e.g., governmental, political and economic. Thus, the primary criterion for manuscript evaluation is the incremental contribution to international accounting literature and the forces that impact the field.\r\nThe Journal aims at understanding the present and potential ability of accounting to aid in analyzing and interpreting international economic transactions and the economic consequences of such reporting. These transactions may be within a profit or non-profit environment. The Journal encourages a broad view of the origins and development of accounting with an emphasis on its functions in an increasingly interdependent global economy. The Journal also welcomes manuscripts that help explain current international accounting practices, with related theoretical justifications, and identify criticisms of current policies and practice. Other than occasional commissioned papers or special issues, all the manuscripts published in the Journal are selected by the editors after the normal double-blind refereeing process."

Our stance is interdisciplinary due to the nature of the subject. Knot theory as a core mathematical discipline is subject to many forms of generalization (virtual knots and links, higher-dimensional knots, knots and links in other manifolds, non-spherical knots, recursive systems analogous to knotting). Knots live in a wider mathematical framework (classification of three and higher dimensional manifolds, statistical mechanics and quantum theory, quantum groups, combinatorics of Gauss codes, combinatorics, algorithms and computational complexity, category theory and categorification of topological and algebraic structures, algebraic topology, topological quantum field theories).\r\nPapers that will be published include:\r\n\r\n-new research in the theory of knots and links, and their applications;\r\n-new research in related fields;\r\n-tutorial and review papers.\r\nWith this Journal, we hope to serve well researchers in knot theory and related areas of topology, researchers using knot theory in their work, and scientists interested in becoming informed about current work in the theory of knots and its ramifications."

Economic considerations, including efficiency, equity, production, allocation, and pollution, have expanded as water resources have become scarcer both in terms of quantity and quality. While economic analyses applied to the water sector are useful and educational, their policy implications are less obvious for guiding policymakers. Water Economics and Policy (WEP) will address the economic-policy interaction by publishing highly technical water economics research with clear relevance for policy. WEP will aim to target a wide range of economic questions at local, regional, national and international levels. It will accommodate work that is focused on specific sectors (such as urban, hydropower, irrigation, and environment) as well as work that is inter-sectoral in nature.\r\nTheoretical and empirical papers are sought as well as those that demonstrate the integration of economics with scientific perspectives to support policy analysis. WEP will also publish book reviews and selected featured policy articles by policymakers in the field of water."

Financial instruments that have been designed to serve the needs of mature capital markets and established trading forums need to be adapted for application in emerging markets and evolving trading venues. The development of new financial products and trading methodologies has also led to new challenges for regulatory bodies. Issues addressed in IJTAF include: (a) development of sophisticated mathematical models based on the principles of modern finance theory, (b) calibration of these models to market data, (c) simulation of such models using efficient computational algorithms, (d) updating of these models in line with evolving market developments, and (e) adaptation of these models by the practitioners in the industry; emphasis will also be placed on (f) development and application of modern stochastic methods in finance.\r\nState-of-the-art financial modelling draws upon expertise from various disciplines besides finance; in particular, experts from mathematics, statistics, economics, and computer science have made significant contributions to this field. IJTAF brings together experts from these multi-disciplines and provides a platform for the synthesis of the various specializations that are actively involved in financial modelling.\r\n\r\nThe disciplines covered by IJTAF include: mathematical finance; financial engineering; applications of modern probability theory and stochastic analysis in finance; models for interest rate, equity, foreign exchange, commodity, credit and inflation-linked products; portfolio theory and long-term investment; quantification of risk; ..."

The journal seeks to provide a rapid forum for the communication of novel research of high quality and with an interdisciplinary flavor. The journal is an ideal forum for communication amongst materials scientists and engineers, chemists and chemical engineers, and physicists in the dynamic fields associated with functional materials.\r\nFunctional materials are designed to make use of their natural or engineered functionalities to respond to changes in electrical and magnetic fields, physical and chemical environment, etc. These design considerations are fundamentally different to those relevant for structural materials and are the focus of this journal. Functional materials play an increasingly important role in the development of the field of materials science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the journal covers theoretical and experimental studies of functional materials, characterization and new applications-related research on functional materials in macro-, micro- and nano-scale science and engineering. Among the topics covered are ferroelectric, multiferroic, ferromagnetic, magneto-optical, optoelectric, thermoelectric, energy conversion and energy storage, sustainable energy and shape memory materials."

The latter are seen as systems comprised of multiple interacting components, or agents. Nonlinear feedback processes, stochastic influences, specific conditions for the supply of energy, matter, or information may lead to the emergence of new system qualities on the macroscopic scale that cannot be reduced to the dynamics of the agents. Quantitative approaches to the dynamics of complex systems have to consider a broad range of concepts, from analytical tools, statistical methods and computer simulations to distributed problem solving, learning and adaptation.

It is the only specialist journal for fluctuations and noise, and it covers that topic throughout the whole of science in a completely interdisciplinary way. High standards of refereeing and editorial judgment are guaranteed by the selection of Editors from among the leading scientists of the field.\r\nFNL places equal emphasis on both fundamental and applied science and the name \"Letters\" is to indicate speed of publication, rather than a limitation on the lengths of papers. The journal uses on-line submission and provides for immediate on-line publication of accepted papers.\r\n\r\nFNL is interested in interdisciplinary articles on random fluctuations, quite generally. For example: noise enhanced phenomena including stochastic resonance; 1/f noise; shot noise; fluctuation-dissipation; cardiovascular dynamics; ion channels; single molecules; neural systems; quantum fluctuations; quantum computation; classical and quantum information; statistical physics; degradation and aging phenomena; percolation systems; fluctuations in social systems; traffic; the stock market; environment and climate; etc."

While some areas of Semantic Computing have appeared as isolated pieces in journals dedicated to individual disciplines, IJSC is a journal that glues these pieces together into an integrated theme with synergetic interactions. It addresses not only the analysis and transformation of signals (e.g., pixels, words) into useful information, but also how such information can be synthesized and accessed. IJSC publishes regular papers, review papers, case studies, tutorials, communications, book reviews, conference reports, industry trends, and product reviews."

The research studies employ creativity, discovery, rationale design and improvement of the physical and chemical properties of materials leading to new paradigms for competitive energy-production. The challenge tests both our fundamental understanding of material and our ability to manipulate and reconfigure materials into practical and useful configurations. Invariably these materials issues arise at the nano-scale!\r\n\r\nFor electricity generation, dramatic breakthroughs are taking place in the fields of solar cells and fuel cells, the former giving rise to entirely new classes of semiconductors; the latter testing our knowledge of the behavior of ionic transport through a solid medium. Inenergy-storage exciting developments are emerging from the fields of rechargeable batteries and hydrogen storage. On the horizon are breakthroughs in thermoelectrics, high temperature superconductivity, and power generation. Still to emerge are the harnessing of systems that mimic nature, ranging from fusion, as in the sun, to photosynthesis, nature's photovoltaic. All of these approaches represent a body of materials–based research employing the most sophisticated experimental and theoretical techniques dedicated to a commongoal. The aim of this series is to capture these advances, through a collection of volumes authored by leading physicists, chemists, biologists and engineers that represent the forefront of energy-related materials research."
